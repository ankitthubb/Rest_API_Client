## DESCRIPTION  ##

The **REST API Client** developed for the Codtech Internship is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed to simplify interaction with RESTful APIs for interns and developers. This utility enables users to send HTTP requests, handle responses, and process data efficiently, providing a practical learning platform for understanding API integration and web communication concepts during the internship.

**Key Features**:
- **HTTP Request Support**: Perform GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests to interact with RESTful APIs.
- **Request Customization**: Easily configure headers, query parameters, and request bodies (JSON, form-data, etc.) for flexible API calls.
- **Response Handling**: Parse and display API responses in multiple formats, including JSON, XML, and plain text.
- **Authentication Support**: Handle common authentication methods like API keys, OAuth, and Bearer tokens for secure API access.
- **Error Management**: Robust error handling for network issues, invalid endpoints, or authentication failures, with clear error messages.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Log requests and responses for easy debugging and analysis during development.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across Windows, Linux, and macOS, ensuring accessibility in various development environments.
- **Beginner-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple command-line or GUI interface, designed to help interns learn API interactions intuitively.

**Purpose**:
Built as part of the Codtech Internship, this REST API Client serves as an educational tool for interns to gain hands-on experience with REST API concepts, including request construction, response parsing, and error handling. It enables interns to integrate APIs into projects, test endpoints, and understand web service communication in real-world scenarios.

**Use Cases**:
- Testing and validating REST API endpoints for internship projects.
- Fetching and processing data from public APIs for data-driven applications.
- Learning API authentication and request-response workflows.
- Automating API interactions for repetitive tasks or project integrations.
